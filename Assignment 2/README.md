# Neural Network Assignment
Version 1 Draft: README.md to be updated...
## Part A: Classification Problem
This project aims at building neural networks to classify the Cardiotocography dataset containing measurements of fetal heart rate (FHR) and uterine contraction (UC) features on 2126 cardiotocograms classified by expert obstetricians. The dataset can be obtained from: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Cardiotocography.

The cardiotocograms were classified by three expert obstetricians and a consensus classification label with respect to a morphologic pattern and to a fetal state (N: Normal; S: Suspect; P: Pathologic) was assigned to each of them. The aim is to predict the N, S and P class labels in the test dataset after training the neural network on the training dataset.

## Part B: Regression Problem
This assignment uses the data from the Graduate Admissions Predication. The dataset contains several parameters like GRE score (out of 340), TOEFL score (out of 120), university Rating (out of 5), strengths of Statement of Purpose and Letter of Recommendation (out of 5), undergraduate GPA (out of 10), research experience (either 0 or 1), that are considered important during the application for Master Programs. The predicted parameter is the chance of getting an admit (ranging from 0 to 1). You can obtain the data from: https://www.kaggle.com/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions
or from file ‘admission_predict.csv’.
